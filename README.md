# AIO Weather Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the AIO Weather Project! This project was developed by a dedicated team of individuals during the ALX curriculum. We aimed to create a comprehensive weather application that leverages APIs, HTTP requests, and state-of-the-art technologies to provide users with accurate and real-time weather information.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
